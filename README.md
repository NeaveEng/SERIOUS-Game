SERIOUS Game
==

This is a Unity application that was designed to run on a Steam Deck to control a small robot designed to rescue a spanner.

Long story...

It's presented as is, with no warranty, and bare in mind it was written as a silly project one Christmas. The code is almost certain a bit janky in places but it works. You will need to install the Unity ROS TCP Connector, more information is available on the [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/tree/main/tutorials/ros_unity_integration)
